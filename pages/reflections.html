                                    I found that learning about GitHub and the integration of VS code 
                                    and GitHub desktop was really interesting. Knowing how to push files 
                                    onto the online GitHub repository is especially useful to know when working 
                                    on different devices or on a collaborative team. I am looking forward to 
                                    learning more HTML and CSS to design and code my first website!

                                    My MRP is a collaborative project with Nichole Zhou called Empowering 
                                    Youth: Career Exploration through Narrative Gameplay. It is a 2D interactive 
                                    storytelling game with word puzzles and multiple endings determined by 
                                    player decisions. We aim to create a realistic peek into student experiences 
                                    within STEM career journeys and inspire prospective student players within their 
                                    own pathways.

                                    It was really cool to see out Figma can be used to extract CSS code. I think 
                                    it really helps to be able to see the size and position of containers when 
                                    designing a website. I didn't even know we could access Figma Dev mode on our 
                                    students accounts...

                                    CSS seems pretty straight-forward but I feel like I'm going to eat my 
                                    words later on... It does look like CSS has lot of cool properties.

                                    The OCBDS strikes again... I say that but I had a lot of fun trying to 
                                    reverse engineer the storyboards of the assignment videos. I have always 
                                    liked storyboarding since I was younger so it was really nice to learn 
                                    the nuances and conventions involved in setting scenes. The examples we 
                                    got to see were really impressive, and I want to get to that level one day.

                            <p>
                                Getting to see everyone's storyboarding styles was very fun. Everyone did 
                                such a good job! When looking at so many storyboards, it really made me realize
                                just how many considerations need to be made in order to create an 
                                efficient storyboard. I think elements like a starting legend, the smart use of colour,
                                various camera movements and cuts, and dynamic arrows and framing are some of the many
                                great techniques that can be used in storyboarding.

                            <p>
                                As for pre-vis of non-linear media, the fundamental elements are 
                                similar but the process and mindset I think is quite different. 
                                You would need to think about the many interactions a user can take 
                                when interacting with the media which is a little overwhleming.
                                Adding linearity like having a linear narrative can definitely help 
                                limit the potential action of the user like in story-based games or
                                looping goals and tasks that have a clear start and end.

                                Scrollytelly is a really interesting form of interactive media.
                                I like the idea of leaving the pace of the story up to the user. 
                                Of course, we also got to see both good and bad examples of 
                                scrollytelling in class. Scrollytelling can be a really expressive
                                and engaging medium but I do think it needs to be designed with a 
                                lot of thought and care or else it can come off as a little gimmicky or 
                                unnecessary.

                                Javacript looks complicated and definitely powerful. 
                                Javascript is the language to code for interactions and reactive
                                elements on webpages. The live coding session was mildly disastrous
                                but I did get the code for the hover interactions on the SVG to work!
                                The SVG excerise will be included here once I get to it...
