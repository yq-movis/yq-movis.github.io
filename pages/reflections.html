    <h2>Week 1 - Introduction to Coding Languages and GitHub</h2>
    <p>
        I found that learning about GitHub and the integration of VS code and GitHub desktop was really interesting. Knowing how to push files onto the online GitHub repository is especially useful to know when working on different devices or on a collaborative team. I am looking forward to learning more HTML and CSS to design and code my first website!

    <h3>Masterâ€™s Research Project (MRP)</h3>
    <p>
        My MRP is a collaborative project with Nichole Zhou called Empowering Youth: Career Exploration through Narrative Gameplay. It is a 2D interactive storytelling game with word puzzles and multiple endings determined by player decisions. We aim to create a realistic peek into student experiences within STEM career pathways and inspire prospective student players in their own journeys.

    <h2>Week 2 - Learning CSS and Figma</h2>
    <p>
        It was really cool to see out Figma can be used to extract CSS code! I think it really helps to be able to see the size and position of containers when designing a website. I didn't know we even had Figma Dev mode on our educational accounts. CSS seems pretty straight-forward but it does have a lot of different properties that I'll need to Google to make sense of.
