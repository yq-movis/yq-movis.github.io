                        <p>
                            On the first day the Course Project was announced,
                            the class were split into three groups based on 
                            everyone's unique interests. Amazingly, there was a group 
                            for augmented reality (AR), something that I am really 
                            interested in but have no knowledge about at all. 
                            After the loose sorting, I met with Jeah and Yu-Wen who were 
                            now my teammates and discuss potential ideas for the app. 
                            We had this general idea of utilizing 3D printed objects as 
                            interactive pieces that would initate different animations or
                            AR models based on how the pieces were connected. 
                            We made a group chat for everyone interested in AR and set a time to meet the next day with some content ideas.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Right before class, the group got together to discuss roles and responsibles. Anaiah is our project lead and admin, focused on the organization and progress tracking of the whole project. Jeah, being our 3D tech master, naturally assumed the role of lead Unity developer. Naomi is the script writer for all the reabable text in teh app, and Yu-Wen is our main animation storyboard designer. I am in charge of UI and UX design. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The topic we chose in the end was on ecosystems. We thought that the various elements that can positively and negatively impact an ecosystem could really fit with our ideation of having users piece a story together by adding components at their own pace and order. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On Thursday, there was a group meeting to iron out some the Project details. I unfortunately missed most of that meeting, but I got filled in afterwards. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On Friday, we met with Alex to discuss the plausibility and appropriateness of our ideas for an AR project. He said it was a good idea and gave us some tips about devices and AR funtionalities and limitations. WE also quickly decided on who was making and presenting what slides for the project proposal presentations next class.

                        <p>
                            This week, we had our project proposal presentations to the class. The other two groups were doing scrollytelling and the ideas they had were really cool! 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I felt pretty good about the concept we were going for but because I missed the meeting, I felt like I wasn't doing enough to help out with the content. I heard that Yu-Wen was taking on a really big task of making all the wireframes herself and offered to lead a hand. Together, we decided to meet on Friday morning to discuss how the app will run and other possible interactions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Yu-Wen and I spent hours trying to make sense of AR and ideating about what we can do with it. We couldn't figure out want time of base shape would be best for AR tracking so we settled for a flat base to not have any possible obstructions and so that the 3D tokens would be able to lie on top of the base. I am very much a visual learner and made a bunch of sketches and rough mockups to help both me and Yu-Wen to visual how the elements within the app will look. I will insert some of those sketches here later. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We came up with hotspots on the AR model would work and the appear of a sidebar where educational information would be displayed. We had this idea to make an interactive mini game within each of these side bars to boost user engagement.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For each of the 4 effector variables, we came up with two animations, and one mini game idea. Tnere would be one primary and one secondary animation that the user would be able to toggle after completing the mini game. The mine game would be a very simple interaction that gives the app some more playability while still presenting educational material. I will insert a table for each variable here later.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The next step was to draft these rough mockups into cleaner wireframes. We went with Figma for this task so we could easily share and collaborate with everyone in the team.

                        <p>
                            Yu-Wen and I split the work for the developer walkthrough. She would be making all the animation storyboards and write up the interactions whereas I would be drawing the base island image and making the UI desgin and base wireframes. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I talked to Alex with Jeah and Naomi after class to get more clarity with how animations would be imported in Unity. Alex provided a lot of great information: animations can be wholesale ported from Maya to Unity using OBJs and FBXs or simple animations can be made directly in Unity. The different idle states with looping animations can be exchanged this way when the variable pieces are added or removed. Alex also questioned the mechanism of playing the animation after finishing the mini game, stating that there should be an immediate reaction to the piece being placed down to fulfil user expectations of change to occur. The mini game interfacing was also mentioned to be very small so there were many adjustments to be made with the previsualization draft deadline coming up. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I then spent the next few hours discussing details about the project with Naomi and Jeah. We had completely filled up the whiteboard by the time this meeting was over. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The main takeways were:

                            <ul>
                                <il>Token design: The 3D variable pieces would be shaped like a flat nail. This way, the plane for the AR tracking would still be relatively the same and the body part of the nail would help the pieces attach to the island 3D base.</il>
                                <il>Low poly wave: Simulating water especially low poly water might be difficult. We talked about different ways we could make the wave that will crash onto the island without the mangroves and Jeah will be testing those ideas in Unity.</il>
                                <il>Mangrove mini game: We thought about changing the content and interaction of the mangrove mini game to be more educational. Instead of planting mangroves one by one, we could teach users about the sea level of each mangrove planting techniques are utilized.</il>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This week was definitely a very busy time with the previsualization draft document due on Friday. I ended up taking Yu-Wen's great animation storyboards and placed them into the wireframe bases I build on Figma. It was a lot of work... maybe I need to streamline my Figma workflow a bit better. I didn't manage to create clean wireframes for all the variables and only submited the mangrove and fishing variable wireframes for the deadline. The other two variables dev walkthrough sections were made by Yu-Wen without some of the changes discussed meeting we had with Alex. 
                        </p>
