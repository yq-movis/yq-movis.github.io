        Hi! This is Max’s course website for MSC 2006

    <h2>Week 1 - Introduction to Coding Languages and GitHub</h2>
    <p>
        I found that learning about GitHub and the integration of VS code and GitHub desktop was really interesting. Knowing how to push files onto the online GitHub repository is especially useful to know when working on different devices or on a collaborative team. I am looking forward to learning more HTML and CSS to design and code my first website!

    <h2>Master’s Research Project (MRP)</h2>
    <p>
        My MRP is a collaborative project with Nichole Zhou called Empowering Youth: Career Exploration through Narrative Gameplay. It is a 2D interactive storytelling game with word puzzles and multiple endings determined by player decisions. We aim to create a realistic peek into student experiences within STEM career pathways and inspire prospective student players in their own journeys.
